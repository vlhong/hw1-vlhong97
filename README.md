# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.
How would you describe this game world in objects?
The game consists of four objects: the player, the plants, seeds, and the UI text for plants remaining/planted. 

What attributes and actions do these objects have?
Attributes to the player is its bunny sprite and the number of seeds it has. Its actions are the ability to move up, down, left, and right using the W, A, S, D keys. They can also plant seeds using the spacebar. The plant object doesn’t have any actions besides existing. An attribute the plant has is its sprite. 

How do these objects act on or affect each other?
The player initiates the action to spawn the plant once pressing the spacebar. The plants do not exist prior to being spawned by the player’s spacebar. The player can only plant the number of seeds it's been previously given at the beginning of the game.

## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.
